# Welcome to Rensetsu! ðŸ‘‹

Rensetsu is a project that aims to map several shows, movies, and books
databases into one relation entry!

This project was inspired by [anime-offline-database][aod] and [arm], but with
a broader scope that encompasses not only anime but also other forms of media
such as movies and books while keeping the database licensed under MIT and CC0
to ensure open access and collaboration among users and developers alike. Our
goal is to create a comprehensive database that allows users to explore and
discover various shows, movies, and books, all in one centralized location.

## Supported Site

Unlike other competitors, we offered a lot of sites to be mapped into

> [!NOTE]

> The following table is not fixed and some sites may removed or added.

## Supported Media

Currently Rensetsu indexed animation title from China, Japan, and Korea (CJK) or
considered to be part of it.

## Data Sourcing

In Rensetsu, data from a site will be scraped/copied based on its schedule. Some
sites may require manual scraping with approximate schedule due to some unique
challenge to solve, written in [ISO 8601 Duration notation](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

Below is a table when and what sites were being scraped, with UTC timezone:
